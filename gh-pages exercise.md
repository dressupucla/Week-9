## GitHub Pages exercise outline

First, log in to your GitHub account.

When creating GitHub pages, we have two options: User site or Project site
  * For a User site, create a new GitHub repository with the name "[username].github.io"
  * For a project site, open or create a repository, then create a folder within named "docs"

Now we want to create an index.html file in our repository (for a User site) or the "docs" folder (for a project site). Instead of creating one from scratch, we're going to use an HTML5 template (fancy!).
  * Take the folder named "website" and put it in your repository or "docs" folder. This contains an index.html file and all the CSS and other code we need for a nice one-page website. 
  * Since we are adding a folder with lots of files, we'll need to clone our repos to our local machines, make the changes, then push our changes back to GitHub.
4. Once our files are in place, return to our repo in GitHub and let's go to the "Settings" tab (if you are creating a User site, you don't need to do this next step).
  * Under the GitHub Pages section, for Source, choose "master branch /docs folder" to use our "docs" folder for GitHub pages. Save your choice.
  * Now you should see a URL for your new GitHub site! Don't worry if the site doesn't load right away - sometimes it can take a bit for the site to build.
5. Now let's learn to use our browser "Developer Tools" to customize our site...
6. After the break, we'll publish some of the visualizations we've created in DResSUP.
