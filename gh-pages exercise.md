## GitHub Pages exercise

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Two options: User site vs. Project site
  * For a User site, create a new GitHub repository with the name "[username].github.io"
  * For a project site, open or create a repository, then create a folder within named "docs"
3. Now we want to create an html file in our repository (for a User site) or the "docs" folder (for a project site). Instead of creating one from scratch, we're going to use an HTML5 template!
